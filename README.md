========

Logberry is a structured logging package for [Go](http://golang.org/)
services and applications.  It is focused on generating logs, rather
than managing them, and tries to be lightweight while capturing more
semantics and structure than is typical, in both readable and easily
parsed forms.


## Introduction

Most log output libraries fall into one of two camps:

 * Super simple, with a global API that's really easy to use but has
   no structure beyond a component label and message level or type;
 * More complex, but focused on extensive formatting controls and/or
   various output serializers, pipes, aggregators, and managers.

Logberry is a bit different, and places more focus on *what* you're
logging, rather than *how*.  At the core, its log events are based
around key/value pairs rather than arbitrary strings, much like
[Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus).  On top of that is a
very light, optional structure for capturing execution stacks,
delineating concurrent output, basic task timing, and other generic
semantics that encourage better, more useful event log structure.

Supporting all that are some very simple concrete output options, much
like many other libraries.  In fact, those tools can be easily dropped
in at this layer.  Although it stands alone just fine, there's a good
chance Logberry is complementary to, rather than competing with, your
preferred log output engine.


## Minimal Example

Logberry can be installed directly through Go:

    go get github.com/BellerophonMobile/logberry

A very simple use is then:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"github.com/BellerophonMobile/logberry"
	"os"
)

func somecomputation(data interface{}) (int, error) {
	return 7, nil
}

func main() {

	// Output autogenerated build information and a hello
	logberry.Main.Build(buildmeta)

	logberry.Main.Info("Start program")

	// Construct a new component of our program
	cmplog := logberry.Main.Component("MyComponent")

	// Create some structured application data
	var data = struct {
		MyString string
		MyInt    int
	}{"alpha", 9}

	// Do some activity on that data, which may fail, within the component
	tlog := cmplog.Task("Some computation", &data)
	res, err := somecomputation(data)
	if err != nil {
		tlog.Error(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	tlog.Complete(&logberry.D{"Result": res})

	// Shut down the component
	cmplog.Finalize()

	// An error has occurred out of nowhere!
	logberry.Main.Fatal("Unrecoverable error", errors.New("Arbitrary fault"))

}
```

The buildmeta object is an instance of `logberry.BuildMetadata`.  It
can be managed by hand or generated using the utility script in
`logberry/util/build-stmt-go.sh`, i.e., as part of the build process:

```sh
  $ ./util/build-stmt-go.sh > examples/minimal/build.go
  $ go build github.com/BellerophonMobile/logberry/examples/minimal
  $ ./minimal
```

In a terminal this produces the output:

## Changelog

 * **2014/10/foo: Release 1.0!** Though definitely not mature at all,
   we consider Logberry to be usable.
